Connect 4 is a Python game that uses the Curses module to control the display.

There is still some stuff to do in this game but its stable.
All information in: http://www.diogonuno.com

Currently doesn't run on Windows due to some curses based error (dunno) but runs on linux and mac. 
It just needs Python Curses Module to run. To play run "python connect4.py" or just run the executable file with ./connect4.py
